You may

If you dislike system-oriented programming or C++, this is not
the course for you.</strong></p><p>As the spiritual successor to Operating Systems (CS 350) and Object-Oriented
Programming (CS 246), this course will revisit your understanding of how
computer programs work, with a twist - now, “multiple things can happen at the
same time!” Like in the games StarCraft or Overcooked, this teaches you how to
micro-manage programs. Making sure you don’t trample all over yourself (or shoot
your own feet with C++11) is quite a feat.</p><p>It’s pretty rewarding, because a lot of real-life software (like web servers,
code editors) are concurrent, and the concepts this course teaches come up often
if you work on low-/medium-level systems code.</p><p>Like 246, the course culminates in a final group project of similar complexity.
Hope you learned to time-manage and work in a team over your co-ops!</p><p>There’s a decent amount of work as debugging concurrent programs is a pain in
the ass, but since this course is mandatory for SE kids, they can’t make it too
hard (because even below average students have to pass).

</p><hr><h2 id=theory-of-computing-cs-360>Theory of Computing (CS 360)</h2><p><strong>Don’t take this course if you’re allergic to proofs. Save your electives and
take 4XX courses instead - they have more useful and interesting material.</strong></p><p>This course is CS 245 with different content. You learn about the properties of
various tools in &ldquo;computation” (see keywords), and prove things about them.
Prove what, you ask? I forgot, so probably nothing important. The only things I
got out of this course are 1) you can’t solve the “balanced parenthesis” problem
without a stack, and 2) some problems can’t always be solved in finite time.

</p><hr><h2 id=numerical-computation-cs-370>Numerical Computation (CS 370)</h2><p><strong>Decent, but there are better 4XX courses out there.</strong></p><p>Despite sharing the name “computation” with 360, this course is vastly different
in what it teaches - specifically, things with decimals, and how to do various
math on a computer. And by doing math, I mean implementing equations in MATLAB
with some fuzzy understanding of how they’re derived (because, hey, we know CS
students can’t do real math on their own).</p><p>There’s not much to say about this course - if you’re taking it, it’s probably
because you want to take Graphics, are an engineer at heart, or dream of being a
quant (not data scientist!), so you’ll take this regardless. If not, the
material this teaches is probably not on your radar of “interesting things”.</p><hr><h2 id=programming-languages-cs-442>Programming Languages (CS 442)</h2><p><strong>This course will make you a better programmer. Warning: top 2 conceptually
hardest course - not for the faint of heart.</strong></p><p>The course with the most misleading name ever. Yes, you will learn enough
Haskell to write Yet Another Haskell Tutorial, but the emphasis of this course
is on understanding the theoretical underpinnings of how programming languages
are <em>designed</em>. You’d learn about lambda calculus with Scheme, type inference
with ML, tree traversals with Prolog, and so on.</p><p>There’s a <em>lot</em> of tricky content to go through, so the course moves really
quickly - I actually went to every class because Lushman covers two lectures’
worth of content in one, everyday.</p><p>You may ask: with such niche languages, how’s this course useful at all (unless
you work at Jane Street)? This course provide you with the theoretical
understanding needed to easily pick up <em>any</em> language, and, more importantly,
teach you how to <em>think about programming</em>. An undervalued skill, since most CS
students are code monkeys who can barely clobber together Java APIs.</p><hr><h2 id=compilers-cs-444>Compilers (CS 444)</h2><p><strong>This course will also make you a better programmer. You will also not have a
life if you take this course.</strong></p><p>Over this course, I learned more about Java than I ever wanted to. Did you know
that, for instance, an <code>interface</code> without any <code>super interfaces</code> implicitly
declares an <code>abstract</code> version of every <code>method</code> in <code>java.lang.Object</code>? Shit
like that’s fun to check and enforce at 3 am after 5 cups of coffee.</p><p>This course is the equivalent of a capstone project for CS kids, except unlike
capstone projects in other programs, you can’t choose to build a fluffy website
with React or Vue.js, and instead have to learn everything about a specific,
archaic version of Java to build a compiler against it. At least you can
implement it using a language of your choice!</p><p>This course teaches you crucial life skills, like nagging your teammates to put
in work, reading the language spec like a lawyer, writing code to pass tests,
refactoring, and learning things like x86 on the fly. Oh, I guess also a few
things about compilers and Java.</p><p>The most valuable you’ll get out of this class is you’ll understand <em>everything
about how a high-level programming language works</em> (aka. every modern language),
from reading your program as plaintext, to validating your idiotic code, to
outputting machine code. You’ll never be confused by a compilation error again.</p><hr><h2 id=security-cs-458>Security (CS 458)</h2><p><strong>Great course. Useful, interesting, and not too difficult. Highly
recommended.</strong></p><p>If there is a course that everyone seems to be taking for some reason and
<em>should</em> take, then this is it. Relatively easy, light on the workload, and full
of useful and applicable concepts, CS 458 is one of the best 4XX courses out
there.</p><p>The lectures are full of useful information, and will slowly teach you words
you’ve heard about in passing, like proxies or TLS certificates. Assignments are
the real gems in this course though - by actually implementing various attacks
against binaries and web servers, you learn to identify, exploit, and guard
against common software vulnerabilities. This skill will be handy to any
software journeyman.</p><hr><h2 id=distributed-computing-cs-451>Distributed Computing (CS 451)</h2><p><strong>Really interesting and applicable course. Highly recommended for the everyday
software engineer.</strong></p><p>If you’re ever thinking of working at any startup/big tech company in the
Valley, you’ll definitely come across the technologies taught in this course.
And this course is all about modern technologies that manipulate Big Data™ -
you’ll learn how to use Hadoop, Spark, and all the other buzzwords in dept.</p><p>At times, this course may seem <em>too</em> applied. The assignments are very
practical - you’ll write programs that run on a Hadoop cluster In The Cloud™ to
compute PageRank and classify text and whatnot. And experience the frustration
of debugging large outputs first-hand.</p><hr><h2 id=financial-modelling-cs-476>Financial Modelling (CS 476)</h2><p><strong>Top 2 conceptually hardest course. There are two types of people who’d take
this course: 1) those dead set on quantitative finance, and 2) bored math and CS
gods. For everyone else, please stay away.</strong></p><p>This course is centred around one question: how do you price
<a href=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/option.asp>options</a>? Black magic, it
turns out - magic you will painstakingly explore over three months.</p><p>This course starts off with a new branch of calculus - Ito’s calculus. It’s like
calculus and probability had a deformed baby. At one point, you have to apply LU
factorization to a matrix of finite difference terms for a partial differential
equation. <em>This is not a joke.</em> If you don’t know everything in STAT 230/MATH
235/237/CS 370 like the back of your hand, you’re in for a very rough ride.</p><hr><h2 id=artificial-intelligence-cs-486>Artificial Intelligence (CS 486)</h2><p><strong>Highly recommended for CS kids who want to “do ML” but can’t math. Just
kidding - it’s a seriously good course to get your feet wet in the field.</strong></p><p>For the easiest fourth-year CS course ever, it’s surprisingly interesting and
useful. The concepts (like <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing>simulated
annealing</a>) are both easy to
grasp and apply in practice. The material is also refreshing - you’re unlikely
to have come across topics like Bayes Nets and HMMs before (unlike, say, Yet
Another Tutorial on logistic regression or neural nets).</p><p>Oh, did I mention this course has basically neither math nor homework?</p><hr><h2 id=cryptography-co-487>Cryptography (CO 487)</h2><p><strong>Great course. Useful, interesting, and not difficult. Highly recommended for
everyone.</strong></p><p>A focused subset of CS 458. You’ll learn all about modern cryptography
techniques like RSA and elliptic-curves in depth, which software engineers
actually use everyday, via SSH, HTTPS, SSL, SHA256, WPA2, and other acronyms
you’ve probably come across as a web developer or something.</p><p>This is also probably the easiest CO course ever - you only need basic MATH 135
knowledge and no coding at all (though it would help).</p></div><div class=post-tags></div></div><div class="footer wrapper"><nav class=nav><div>Copyright © 2021 Shine Wang</div></nav></div><script type=application/javascript>var doNotTrack=!1;doNotTrack||(window.ga=window.ga||function(){(ga.q=ga.q||[]).push(arguments)},ga.l=+new Date,ga('create','UA-77783144-1','auto'),ga('send','pageview'))</script><script async src=https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js></script></body></html>
